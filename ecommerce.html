        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Developed a dynamic front-end website with the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An indicator showing the number of search results or products available.</li>
            <li>Sorting the items by: name, price, or rating.</li>
            <li>The ability to show only in-stock items in the search results.</li>
            <li>Adding or removing items from the shopping basket.</li>
            <li>A total cost of products in the shopping basket.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I learned how to implement these functionalities using TypeScript and became familiar with React components and hooks.</p>
